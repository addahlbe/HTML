HTML
====

This is a really good start.

Now try to remove your 'built in' style and make an external css sheet.

This will teach you how packaging, and acessing outside modules works.

You can learn how to do css at w3 schools also, they show the 3 ways of css.
    1. Inline
    2. Inpage
    3. External

External is the best because when you want uniformity against a long array of pages,
you can acess the same css variables, or even assign style to specific html tags.
ex.

# p{
    border: thick;
    text-align: right;
}

this will make every <p> tag you create have those specific values.


when you add style to this new page try to format it the following


-----------------------------------------
Title

------------------------------------------
Nav Bar
-----------------------------------------
column      Main                column
white       Data                white
space                            space





--------------------end body----------------
footer / credits /contact info
--------------------------------------------


This is called a layout, and is a very standard, clean design.

Next, php or pyramid.
